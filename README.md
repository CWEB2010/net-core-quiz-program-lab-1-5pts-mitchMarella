# .NET Core Quiz Program (Lab 1 - 5pts.)

You are going to build a quiz application that requires you to generate 10 questions along with 4 option choices for each question.  You will do some research on .NET Core and decide upon 10 questions that will assess the quiz taker's knowledge on .NET Core 

## Instructions

Listed below is the correct answer key for your quiz.

```bash
 1) B 	| 2) B 	| 3) C 	| 4) A 	|  5) D 	
 ------	|------	|------	|------	|-------	
 6) A 	| 7) A 	| 8) C 	| 9) D 	| 10) A 	
```
Your program should store these correct answers in an array.  (Store each question’s correct answer in an element of a String array.)  The program will iterate through each question and allow the quiz taker to enter a answer for each question, which should be stored in another array. After the student’s answers have been entered, the program should display a message indicating whether the student passed or failed the exam.  (A student must correctly answer 7 of the 10 questions to pass the quiz.)  It should then display the total number of correctly answered questions, the total number of incorrectly answered questions, and a list showing the question numbers of the incorrectly answered questions.

Please enforce
